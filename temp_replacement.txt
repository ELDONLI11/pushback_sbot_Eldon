Line to replace:  sbot_score_low_for(requested_ms);

The only change from the pasted code is: 
- Remove the sbot_score_low_for() call in the low_goal_case section (around line 630 of the pasted code)
- This keeps the balls in the robot for long goal scoring

User wants to use the old low goal approach code (45° front-score) but WITHOUT running intake to score.
